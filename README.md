# 🗃️ dotfiles

this repo is the collection of all the main config files that I use and have built.

## list of tools
- 🚀 Aerospace as my tiling window manager
- 👻 Ghostty as my main terminal emulator
- 🐚 Zshell as my default shell
- 🏗️ Tmux as my terminal multiplexer
- 📝 NeoVim as my code editor
- ⌨️ Raycast as my all-in-one QoL tool

everything in this repo is managed using GNU Stow.

## things to do
### 📝 neovim config
- [ ] fix weird line in *alpha.nvim*
- [ ] change formatting: not for every buffer but only for those with Lsp Attached

### 🏗️ tmux config
- [ ] try sessionx plugin
