# dotfiles

this repo is the collection of all the main config files that I use and have built.

## list of tools
- Aerospace as my tiling window manager
- Ghostty as my main terminal emulator
- Zshell as my default shell
- Tmux as my terminal multiplexer
- NeoVim as my code editor
- Raycast as my all-in-one QoL tool

everything in this repo is managed using GNU Stow.

## things to do
### neovim config
- [ ] fix weird line in *alpha.nvim*
- [ ] change formatting: not for every buffer but only for those with Lsp Attached

### tmux config
- [ ] try sessionx plugin
